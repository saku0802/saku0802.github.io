            <h3>Director & Project Manager</h3>
            <h4>Next Corporation | October 2022 - November 2023</h4>
            <p>As a product owner for the development and release of the SNS management tool "Twittersskills," I spearheaded product strategy planning, development policy decisions, management of the entire engineering team, and the implementation and optimization of Agile development methodologies. In addition, for corporate SaaS marketing consulting, I was in charge of three companies, where I planned and executed SNS marketing strategies, analyzed access status using website analysis tools, proposed improvements, managed advertising, and measured effectiveness for client companies. Through these tasks, I honed my skills in product development, team management, marketing strategy, data analysis, customer negotiation, and presentation. The tools I used include GitHub, Slack, Zoom, Google Analytics, and Google Ads.</p>

            <h3>SNS Marketing Consultant</h3>
            <h4>Freelancer | June 2022 - April 2023</h4>
            <p>I provided consulting services to five client companies, including planning and executing SNS marketing strategies, content planning and production, operation outsourcing, effect measurement, and improvement proposals. In order to contribute to achieving client companies' performance goals, I conducted competitor research, target analysis, persona setting, KPI design, content calendar creation, and SNS advertising operations. As a result, I was able to reduce the marketing costs of client companies by an average of 35% and increase lead acquisition by an average of 200% month-on-month. Through this experience, I improved my skills in customer communication, marketing strategy planning, content marketing, SNS advertising management, effect measurement, and reporting. The tools I used include Google Spreadsheet, Facebook Business Manager, and Twitter Ads Manager.</p>

            <h3>Marketing Strategy Manager</h3>
            <h4>Myli Corporation | April 2021 - June 2022</h4>
            <p>I was responsible for planning and executing SNS account operation strategies, content planning and production, effect measurement, and improvement proposals. I led the rapid growth of accounts, such as acquiring 130,000 followers from 0 in 5 months on the X account. I also contributed to a 150% increase in sales for the entire team (from 8 million yen to 13.5 million yen). When the main sales platform became unavailable, I contributed to maintaining sales by building a company EC site using Shopify as a crisis management measure and smoothly migrating users. Through these tasks, I improved my skills in team management, leadership, content marketing, SNS operation, crisis management response, and EC site construction and operation. The tools I used include Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Google Analytics, Canva, and Shopify.</p>
