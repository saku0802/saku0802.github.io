            </div>
            <p>At Myli Corporation, I achieved remarkable results as Marketing Strategy Manager. Of particular note is the rapid growth of SNS accounts, starting from scratch with an X account and gaining 130,000 followers in just 5 months. This strategic SNS marketing increased the entire team's sales by 150% from 8 million yen to 13.5 million yen. I also demonstrated crisis management skills, and when the main sales platform became unavailable, I quickly built a company website, migrated users, and maintained sales. I planned and executed integrated SNS marketing strategies, developed and creatively directed content strategies, and supervised a 5-person team responsible for SNS operations, content creation, and data analysis.</p>
